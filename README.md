# Finding Name-o (naming in coding)

Finding Name-o will most likely be the biggest time waster for a programmer, spending 20% on writing logic and then 80% on thinking about what name to give to a function or a variable (Which will eventually be alien when opened the next day). :smile: *Is that even supposed to be funny !!*

## Right now it's going to be bunch of examples of naming I guess. Ideas are welcome

`val y = Calendar.getInstance().get(Calendar.YEAR) // 2lzy.. `:sleeping:

`val year = Calendar.getInstance().get(Calendar.YEAR) // what year `:unamused:

`val thisYear = Calendar.getInstance().get(Calendar.YEAR) // so so ..`:smirk:

:purple_heart: `val currentYear = Calendar.getInstance().get(Calendar.YEAR) // makes you look professional (or may even looks like you copied from internet)`
